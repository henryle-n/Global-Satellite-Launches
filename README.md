# The Era of Global Communications and Surveillance

## Background
Have you ever wondered how people can call each other from anywhere in the world at any time?  

Or, have you ever wondered why our phone is so smart that it knows our location and give us direction to wherever we want to go, or may be how the pilots know where to fly too, there is no landmark up there in the air...?

Thanks to 2,666 Satellites that currently orbiting earth, all of those are made possible. In this project, the team of three, led by **Henry Le**, with team members of **Ekin Kaplan** and **O.J. Ndebbio**.
